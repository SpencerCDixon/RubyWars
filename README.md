# Ruby Wars

Ruby Wars is a knockoff of the arcade classic Geometry Wars.  The goal of the game is to build a program that will save the world.  Along the way you have to fight off all the bugs trying to destroy your program.  If you get hit by a bug then the game is over.  For each bug you kill your points go up and the longer you stay alive the more points you get for killing bugs.

Along the way you will find power ups that you can use to help you build the program.  There are help requests that drop in the form of pictures of the Experience Engineers at [Launch Academy](http://www.launchacademy.com).  When used the help requests will kill all bugs currently on the screen.  If you find the Rails power up you will increase the speed that your bullets shoot in order to write the program quicker.  Finally, the last power up you can get is binding.pry.  When you activate a pry all bugs are paused so you can go around and kill them.
